<p>I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in LMBA (Brest), working with Ismael Bailleul. Previously, I was an ATER in Univeriste Paris-Cite, and before that I was a PhD student in Universite Paris-Dauphine, working with Paul Gassiat.</br> 

My PhD thesis was entitled <i>TODO</i>. The defence took place on 27 June 2024. Here's the composition of the jury:

<li><b>President:</b> Laure Coutin (<i>IMT, Toulouse</i>)</li>


</br>
</br>My research interests are in stochastic analysis, in particular:

<li>Regularisation by noise and long time behaviour of singular systems</li>
<li>Singular SPDEs, paracontrolled calculus</li>
<li>Fractional Brownian motion</li>

</br>

In the past, before my PhD, I was working in the software industry, as a part of R&D teams in various machine learning teams. I was in Samsung Research and smaller companies in Poland (DaftCode, OKE Poland).
